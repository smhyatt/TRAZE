**Abstract:**

As the economy continues to grow, the demand for food, energy and materials follows suit. Climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution are globally pressing matters that require a fundamental transformation of resource-producing, consum- ing and recovering systems, to which sustainable supply chain management (SCM) and Carbon Credits (CCs) have gained momentum.

This thesis introduces TRAZE, a generic prototypic framework for total resource accounting of supply chain networks (SCNs), particularly addressing carbon ac- counting and CCs. TRAZE implements REALISTIC, an event-based modelling framework by Bager, Düdder, Henglein, Hébert, & Wu, 2022, and extends the alge- braic resource accounting framework by Hébert, 2020 and the prototype by Alstrup & Borgert, 2022.

We demonstrate that it is formally possible to model and compute the carbon effect based on event data, where event data comprises assertions that something has happened or is measured. We provide a tool for interpreting data and deriving information related to SCNs and carbon emissions, and we address and analyse common attack vectors and challenges related to CCs. To prove our hypothesis, we implement a model and compute the carbon effect applied to a simple yet il- lustrative use case based on the Columbian coffee SCN. In conclusion, we argue that TRAZE is a flexible framework for fine-grained tracking of production and transportation of physical resources and reliably modelling their direct and indirect carbon effects across mutually distrusting actors in SCNs.
